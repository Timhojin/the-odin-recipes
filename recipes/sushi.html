        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!</p>
    
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>sushi rice</li>
            <li>rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>seaweed</li>
            <li>wasabi paste</li>
            <li>smoked salmon</li>
            <li>a cucumber</li>
            <li>an avocado</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak and cook the rice, then mix in the vinegar and cool in an even layer on a plate.</li>
            <li>Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.) Don't use too much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so you can seal up the roll. <strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Wet your fingers as you spread the sticky sushi rice over the nori.</li>
            <li>Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.</li>
            <li>Roll the sushi tightly and cut into eight pieces.</li>
        </ol>
